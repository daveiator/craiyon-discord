# craiyon-discord
 A discord bot for requesting images from craiyon.com

 This is the repository for craiyon-discord, a discord bot which takes a promt from the chat and returns a set of images generated from [craiyon.com](https://craiyon.com).

 This bot is not anything official from the craiyon team, but rather an individual project which only fetches images from the public backend.

 Should this infringe on any legal rights, please let me know!

 ## TODOS:

- [ ] Deploy official bot
- [ ] Add documentation
